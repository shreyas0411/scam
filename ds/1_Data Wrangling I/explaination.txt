Sure! Here's an expanded version of your steps, 1 through 22, explained in a neat and clear way for presentations:

---

### ðŸ“Š **Step-by-Step Data Analysis Explanation**

---

#### **1. Imported Required Library**

We imported the **pandas** library, which is essential for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It allows us to work with structured data efficiently.

---

#### **2. Loaded the Dataset**

We used `pd.read_csv("data.csv")` to load the dataset into a DataFrame called `df`. This lets us access and analyze the data easily.

---

#### **3. Checked Data Types**

We used `df.dtypes` to examine the data types of each column (e.g., int, float, object). This is important to understand how data is stored and if any conversion is needed.

---

#### **4. Viewed Summary Statistics**

`df.describe()` gave us basic statistical details like mean, standard deviation, min, and max for numeric columns. This helps identify patterns and potential outliers.

---

#### **5. Grouped Data by Age**

We grouped the data by the `Age` column to see how many records exist for each age. This helps understand the distribution of age values.

---

#### **6. Checked for Missing Data**

We used `df.isna().sum()` and `df.isnull()` to check for null or missing values in the dataset. Identifying and handling missing data is crucial for building reliable models.

---

#### **7. Verified Data Type Using Pythonâ€™s Type Function**

We checked the type of the `"Age"` and `"BMI"` using `type("Age")`, which technically checks if it's a string. (Note: This is not the correct way to check column data types.)

---

#### **8. Converted Age Column to Float**

We used `df.Age.astype(float)` to convert the Age column from integer to float for precision and consistency in calculations.

---

#### **9. Sorted Data by Age**

We used `df.sort_values('Age')` to sort the data in ascending order and `ascending=False` for descending. This helps in spotting trends or extremes in age.

---

#### **10. Renamed a Column**

We renamed the column `Age` to `Year Old` using `df.rename(columns={'Age':'Year Old'})`. Renaming columns improves clarity and readability.

---

#### **11. Sorted and Reset Index**

We sorted the DataFrame by index using `sort_index()` and reset the index using `reset_index()` to maintain data structure after sorting or filtering.

---

#### **12. Dropped the Age Column**

We used `df.drop(columns=['Age'])` to remove the Age column from the dataset when it was no longer needed.

---

#### **13. Reshaped the Data**

We used `pd.melt(df)` to transform the dataset from a wide format to a long format, making it easier to visualize or group variable-value pairs.

---

#### **14. Removed Duplicate Records**

Used `df.drop_duplicates()` to remove repeated rows and ensure the data is clean and accurate.

---

#### **15. Displayed First and Last Rows**

We used `df.head(5)` and `df.tail(5)` to preview the top and bottom 5 rows of the dataset. This helps verify if data was loaded correctly.

---

#### **16. Counted Non-Null Values**

Used `df.count()` to count non-null entries in each column. It gives a quick idea of how much usable data we have.

---

#### **17. Displayed Unique Values Per Column**

Used a loop to print all unique values in each column. This helps understand categorical columns and detect inconsistencies.

---

#### **18. Converted Non-Numeric Values in â€˜Classificationâ€™ Column**

We used `pd.to_numeric()` with `errors='coerce'` to convert values in the `Classification` column into numeric, replacing invalid entries with `NaN`.

---

#### **19. Calculated Median**

We used `df.median()` to get the median value of each numeric column. Median is less affected by outliers compared to mean.

---

#### **20. Calculated Min, Max, and Mean**

We used `df.min()`, `df.max()`, and `df.mean()` to understand the overall range and average of the dataset.

---

#### **21. Standardized Data for Analysis**

We converted all columns to numeric using `df.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')` and calculated the standard deviation with `df.std()` to understand data spread.

---

#### **22. Applied One-Hot Encoding**

We used `pd.get_dummies()` on categorical columns like `Age` and `Glucose` to convert them into binary format for machine learning use.
