Here are the **10 most important steps** from your second notebook, explained simply and clearly for presentation purposes:

---

### ðŸ“˜ **Key Steps in Data Cleaning and Visualization (Notebook 2)**

---

#### **1. Imported Necessary Libraries**

Imported `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for handling data, performing operations, and visualizing results.

---

#### **2. Loaded the Academic Dataset**

Read the CSV file named `acdemic_data.csv` into a DataFrame called `df`, which contains student-related academic records.

---

#### **3. Handled Custom Missing Values**

Defined a list of common missing value formats (e.g., `"n.a."`, `"?"`, `"--"`) and ensured they were correctly treated as `NaN` when reading the file.

---

#### **4. Checked for Missing Values**

Used functions like `isnull()`, `notnull()`, and `sum()` to identify missing data in specific columns and across the entire dataset.

---

#### **5. Filtered Out Rows with Missing Data**

Used conditions and filters to display only the non-null rows for better data quality.

---

#### **6. Dropped Missing Data**

Removed rows or columns with missing values using `dropna()` to avoid inaccuracies in further analysis.

---

#### **7. Replaced Missing Values with Constants**

Filled null values in the `SPOS` column with zero using `fillna(0)`â€”useful when zero is a meaningful default value.

---

#### **8. Forward and Backward Fill Techniques**

Used `method='pad'` to fill missing values with the previous row's value, and `method='bfill'` to use the next row's valueâ€”great for time series or sequential data.

---

#### **9. Verified Changes**

Used `head()` to view the top rows after filling nulls, ensuring that the replacements worked correctly.

---

#### **10. Visualized Data with Boxplots**

Plotted boxplots for columns like `SPOS`, `DSBDA`, and `WT` to detect outliers and understand the distribution of scores.

Would you like me to do the same for the third notebook you uploaded?
